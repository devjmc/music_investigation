# Experiments with Google Colab and DeepBach

Load notebook in google drive and run it in Google Colab. 

DeepBachTry.ipynb: uses Ghadjeres/Deepbach (pytorch). Check its readme.
Github repository will be installed in Colab VM. Enable GPU in Colab.
Errors with default configuration during training.
Seems an error of original repository.
